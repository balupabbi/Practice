String Patterns
1) Use 256 length integer array to track characters in a string. Can be used to detect if two strings are anagrams
2) Use two pointers in a string (For example if you want to reverse a string)
3) Know how to convert between characters and integers, take character and convert to ASCII value.
4) String comparision and alignment and matching(Longest common substring), look into recursion blogpost
5) String alg (focus on strategy/concepts of alg)
6) Number 1 mistake people make with string problems is time complexity
